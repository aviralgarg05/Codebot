## MindsDB Integration

Codebot integrates with MindsDB to enhance its predictive capabilities. MindsDB allows Codebot to analyze historical data and provide predictions and insights. This feature helps developers make informed decisions based on data trends and patterns.

### Setting Up MindsDB

1. Install MindsDB:
    ```sh
    pip install mindsdb
    ```
2. Start MindsDB server:
    ```sh
    mindsdb --api=http
    ```
3. Connect Codebot to MindsDB by configuring the connection settings in the `config.json` file.

## Probot Integration

Probot is a framework for building GitHub Apps to automate and improve your workflow. Codebot integrates with Probot to offer enhanced project management capabilities directly within GitHub repositories.

### Setting Up Probot

1. Install Probot:
    ```sh
    npm install -g probot
    ```
2. Create a new Probot app:
    ```sh
    probot create my-first-app
    ```
3. Configure your Probot app with the necessary permissions and webhooks to interact with your GitHub repository.

   
### Example Use Cases

- **Code Review Predictions**: Predict potential issues in code reviews based on historical data.
- **Task Completion Estimates**: Provide estimates for task completion times based on previous projects.
- **Performance Insights**: Analyze performance metrics to suggest optimizations.
